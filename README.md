## NodeJs Console App

* Typescript is used in this project.
* The objective is to test the possible inputs and outputs, interactive menus, display lists and more using this technology.
* As a bonus, what appears on the screen has been decorated with the colors library.
* An initial template common to any nodejs application is also saved as a tag.
